# Sprint-after-death
Make Minecraft not untoggle your sprint after you die

it basically checks if you have sprint on and if you have sprint set to toggle when the game is about to reset your sprint, it resets your sprint and then it makes you sprint again if you had sprint toggled on before the reset happened...
